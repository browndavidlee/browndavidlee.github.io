00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hi, my name is David Brown, and this is a reading writing class.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello, welcome. How are you?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hi, nice to meet you.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Nice to meet you too. My name is David. What's your name?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
My name is Francesco. Pleasure to meet you, David.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Nice to meet you, Francesco. Welcome.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I see that you selected a lesson about Walt Whitman and his famous poem,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Oh, captain, my captain, a reading and writing class. Is that right?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yes, that is correct.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Okay, great.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So I'll tell you a little bit about Abraham Lincoln.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You've probably heard of honest Abe before he was the 16th US president.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
He was assassinated in 1865.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You might compare him to another famous leader. Do you know who this guy is?

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yes, Francisco Morazán.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Francisco Morazán. Okay, so they're not the same, but they are very popular presidents, right?

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Correct. Yes.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So this question for us is what makes a good leader?

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Take a minute to think about it, and then you can share with me and talk about this.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What makes a good leader in your opinion?

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Okay.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Do you want me to write it down or can I just start?

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yeah, you can.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I think it's not only someone that inspires, but also knows when to take action.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Okay.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Alright, agreed. Somebody with initiative, right?

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yes, absolutely.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I think both of these leaders were leaders who inspired others and took a great initiative.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I would agree.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Both of them were involved with some great liberal reforms as well.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Alright, so we have a list of things that can help us to improve our English in particular reading and writing and speaking too since we'll be having a conversation throughout the entire lesson.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
These are our class objectives.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Can you read the class objectives starting with this one here?

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes, identify and explain the historical context of O-Captain, My Captain.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Define key vocabulary.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
For example,

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
?legy,

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
keel, rack,

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
or is it

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
elegy.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And identify and extend it metaphor within the poem.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Analyze the extended metaphor, explaining what the captain, ship, fearful trip and prize represent.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Discuss the tone of the poem as it relates to grief and admiration.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And express understanding of the poem through discussion and written responses.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Okay.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Oh, and connect the poem's themes of loss, leadership, and national strategy to broader concepts of freedom.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Is it a freedom?

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Like freedom.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yeah.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Oh, like freedom.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yeah.

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Alright, so we have a lot that we can do.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We might not have time to do all of this, but certainly there is a lot to digest about this poem.

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And well, well, Whitman and historical context here.

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The vocabulary can be a little bit antiquated because it's, it was written in 1865 right after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So I just want you to keep that in mind as we read this.

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
There's a context to this poem.

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And maybe it's talking about something a little deeper.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So when we say extended metaphor, you know, a metaphor is when A is B.

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:01,000
But an extended metaphor is when maybe a whole paragraph or text is standing for something.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Okay.

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So some historical context here.

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But first here, what do you know about the American Civil War or Abraham Lincoln?

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Oh, I know, I know the nickname honest Abe.

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
(The) American Civil War was specifically regarding slavery.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
If I'm not mistaken, correct?

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yes.

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
North and the South.

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And then Abraham Lincoln.

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Well, you said the 16th president, but I think there's something.

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I think there was a very important decision he took and I can't quite remember it.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Something that he's really known about.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The emancipation proclamation.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yeah.

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
All right.

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
All right.

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Excellent.

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So you know some about the American Civil War in the context of this poem.

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
How important this was the Civil War in the United States.

80
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Didn't just affect the United States had a cascade effect to other countries.

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And really changed a lot of attitudes.

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And it wasn't over at the end of the Civil War.

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And it's still not over.

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Really, we still fight with inequality.

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
We still fight with issues related to slavery around the world.

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And this question about what it really means to be free.

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And it's still an uphill battle.

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So we what Whitman wrote, oh, captain, my captain in 1865 shortly after two major events here.

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Can you read this part for us?

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Of course, the end of the Civil War, which lasted from 1861 to 1865.

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
A rural conflict that divided the nation.

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And the assassination of President Abraham Abraham Lincoln in April 1865 just days after the Confederates surrender.

93
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Lincoln was seen by many as the captain who had steered the nation.

94
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
the ship... through the fearful trip of the war.

95
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So we see an example of a metaphor already the nation as the ship he steered it he was the captain.

96
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
in this poem that we're going to read.

97
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So that we have another colored picture of Abraham Lincoln.

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I just think it's cool that they can put color to old pictures now.

99
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And it makes it look real.

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And a scene from something that you would have seen in the newspaper.

101
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So Abraham Lincoln was in a theater when he was shot and assassinated.

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
All right.

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So here we have some terms that we need to know.

104
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And you might hesitate with some of these vocabulary words.

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
They're a little difficult.

106
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So we have lyric, elegy, metaphor and extended metaphor.

107
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Lyric poetry is poetry that expresses personal emotions or feelings.

108
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's typically spoken in the first person.

109
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So the poem that we're about to read is lyric poetry.

110
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And this one, remember the pronunciation, elegy, could you read this for us?

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yes.

112
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
A poem of serious reflection, typically a lament for the dead.

113
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Oh, captain, my captain is an elegy for Abraham Lincoln.

114
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
All right.

115
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So we're talking about someone a captain who was killed.

116
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And so the poem is really deep.

117
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And it's a little dark in that sense.

118
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You have to imagine the feeling at the end of a war.

119
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The feeling at the end of the war is one of relief.

120
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
you could imagine, but also great sadness.

121
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You can't bring back the lives that were lost.

122
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You can't undo what was done.

123
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What was done was done.

124
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
We have a metaphor, a figure of speech in which a word or phrase is applied.

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So when one thing is another, and then this extension of that, the extended metaphor.

126
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Could you read this one for us?

127
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yes.

128
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
A metaphor that is developed over several lines of writing or even throughout an entire work.

129
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Great.

130
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So here's the first reading.

131
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'll read this first one for you.

132
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I want you to listen to the way that this sounds.

133
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
While follow eyes and steady keel.

134
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The vessel grim and daring.

135
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But oh, heart, heart, heart.

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Oh, the bleeding drops of red.

137
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Where on the deck, my captain lies, fallen cold and dead.

138
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So we have this image of a ship with a keel.

139
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So certain part of the ship, right?

140
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The vessel grim and daring.

141
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You see this dark ship entering.
