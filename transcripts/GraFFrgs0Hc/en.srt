00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
Hello, welcome everybody. How is everybody doing today? This is going to be an

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,880
awesome listening and speaking class. I'm so glad that all of you are here. Welcome

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,920
everybody. Like training a muscle. The brain is not a muscle but we build

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,560
connections. We build stronger connections and so our aim today is for your

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,840
answers to try to be natural, fluent and clear. You might notice that I'm

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,800
typing as you speak. Try to look at some of these corrections that I'm making

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,040
some of them are just rephrasing of what you could say maybe a little bit

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,360
better. It improve your fluency. But I don't want it to interrupt your speaking.

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,040
Just try to focus on being natural, fluent and clear. The whole goal is to

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,240
understand and be understood. Here's a question. What's one thing you already feel

11
00:00:49,240 --> 00:01:05,000
good about when speaking English? I don't know. That's a hard one. Okay, so I

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,680
think it's like now when I speak English, I don't feel like embarrassed if

13
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,800
something somebody correct me. So I think that's what something I feel good

14
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:30,720
now. That comes with experience really. That does help. And the next one, what's

15
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:41,960
one area you think might be challenging in an English interview and why? I think

16
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:54,120
it will be like the new vocabulary and (I) have to express or like as you mentioned

17
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:06,240
trying to put what I'm thinking in something like a more clear and in short.

18
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:16,120
*In size. Yes. Okay. And trying to say something clearly and concisely.

19
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:26,520
All right. I agree. All of these things can be improved too the more you do it. So we

20
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,440
could try to improve how we say things to make them more clear or concise in

21
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:39,320
today's lesson. One of the most popular interview questions that they ask is

22
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:44,040
tell me about yourself. They want you to open up. They want you to break the ice.

23
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,480
They've asked this question a million times. Some people use this in order to

24
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:57,920
impress the other person or like I said, break the ice. What do they really want?

25
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,240
What they really want is something brief, right? One to two minutes. A relevant

26
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:09,000
summary of your professional background, your skills, career goals, these

27
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,520
essential things that they need to know. Why? Because if this is the first question,

28
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:19,880
they need to have a very good one, a very strong positive first impression of

29
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:25,920
you for that first question they ask. Here's an activity for your dream job. What

30
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,320
are one to two key achievements or skills you'd highlight and your tell me about

31
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:41,640
yourself answer. What are two skills or achievements you would highlight? I think it

32
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:53,880
will be something related with decision making. And I think the other one will be

33
00:03:53,880 --> 00:04:02,920
with like, I don't know how to say it's like when you learn something by

34
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:14,440
yourself. So one skill is that you are good at making decisions and that you

35
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,920
and the other one is that you know a lot about yourself. The other one is like if

36
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:29,040
I don't if I don't know something, I look for it until I know it. Okay. And I

37
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:41,080
learn, I try to learn by myself before I on your own. Right, so learn on my

38
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,880
own before I asked for help. So you consider yourself to be an autonomous

39
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:54,160
person. You're capable of working alone autonomously. Is that right? Yes, I can

40
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:09,960
work both, but yeah, I try to look first by myself. And I think this would

41
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:15,520
highlight the fact that you are capable of making good decisions that they're

42
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,560
not going to have to micromanage what you do that you trust that you can find

43
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,400
the correct answer that you're not going to be a burden on them and that you

44
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,240
have the necessary skills. I think that's a good way to make a good first

45
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:44,240
impression. Yeah, yes. So we have some different phrases that we can use to answer

46
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,520
this question. For example, if I were to tell someone about myself, I'd say my

47
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,520
name is David Brown. I'm passionate about teaching English as a second

48
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:02,520
language. I've had about 24,000 sessions online with students from all around

49
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:08,200
the world. I have taught younger students in middle school and high school

50
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:18,000
really identify with the work that I do in my free time. I think about it as

51
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,600
well. I like to spend time with my family and friends and dream about new

52
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:30,280
technology. I don't know. That's what I might have a job interview in a

53
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,000
little bit. Norma, tell me, do you think that would make a good first impression?

54
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:42,880
Yes. Oh, I hope so. I don't know if this lesson is better for me or for you

55
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:53,760
actually. Thank you. Thank you. Norma, this lesson is free. All right, so what made

56
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,920
that example easy to understand? I think I spoke a little bit too fast, but what

57
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:06,520
do you think? What made that example easy to understand? No, actually, what I

58
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:17,120
like listen (heard) was about the time that you have the experience that you have.

59
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:28,880
And also I can see like with the range of age that you can work. So

60
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:38,240
I know that you can do it with older or younger. And also that you are somebody

61
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:45,720
that takes care of our family. Okay, also, yeah, you have some good listening

62
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:51,520
skills already. What I, instead of saying what I listen*, you could say what I, what

63
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,680
I heard rather, you could say what I heard was about the experience that you

64
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:00,480
have and also see the age ranges you can work for. So I know you can work with

65
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:09,120
younger or older people. I understood you perfectly. All right, so we also have

66
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,480
this other really big question. It's always asked when you're asked what are

67
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:19,880
your strengths? We have a chance to shine. We can show other people what we've

68
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:28,600
got. What are your strengths, Norma? So you can, but what, but it's going to be

69
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:34,960
specific about this, right? Because we can, we can tell someone that we are good

70
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:40,680
listener, but when were you a good listener? And what situation can you be more

71
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:46,280
specific? This can really help. If you can demonstrate specific, specific

72
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,240
examples. And then when you're asked, what is your greatest weakness? You can

73
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,360
choose a real minor weakness you're actively improving. So this shows that

74
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,320
you're honest. And they say that you should avoid cliche is like, I'm a

75
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,040
perfectionist, unless you can generally back it up. Are you really a perfectionist?
