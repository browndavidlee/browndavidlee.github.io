00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,740
Hello, welcome everybody. How is everybody doing today? This is going to be an

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,900
awesome listening and speaking class. I'm so glad that all of you are here. Welcome

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:18,980
everybody. See the screen. All right. Now? Yes. Okay. So remember, good

4
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,220
communication starts with good listening, being an active listener means showing

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:29,820
you're engaged. Sometimes we listen quickly for the main idea and that's our

6
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,780
fast and intuitive thinking and other times we need careful analytical

7
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:42,540
listening and that's when we really kind of pick things apart and try to

8
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,380
understand the deeper meaning of those things. So we need to practice both types

9
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:52,620
of listening to understand the superficial level of things in the meaning and

10
00:00:52,620 --> 00:01:03,380
to understand (the) deeper analytical level of things. When you practice a lot, you get

11
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:11,780
the hang of it and you don't have to kind of deliberately seek to understand it

12
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:18,180
so much. You'll just understand and it will become more intuitive with time but

13
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:25,140
it's always good to analyze first. So we'll listen as the scenario is read

14
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,540
here. I want you to listen to it twice with different focuses and I'm trying to

15
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,380
show something that you might not understand. So don't feel bad if you don't. Okay.

16
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:41,220
All right. Okay, team. For the new project, I need everyone to synergize their

17
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,980
deliverables by COB Tuesday and ensure proactive stakeholder engagement. Make it

18
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:59,380
snappy. Did you understand? The main idea, but there are some new words

19
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,700
others are okay. Okay, so you have some experience which is great. You've got the

20
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:09,940
main idea that we need to work together to get something done but there might

21
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,860
be some things here that you don't understand. Which words are hard for you to

22
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,060
understand? So the words that I don't understand are

23
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:27,460
synergize and snappy. Okay, so to synergize something is basically to make

24
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:32,020
things in sync, right? When things are synchronized, they're synergized. They

25
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,700
work well together, right? So we need everybody to basically come together and

26
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:45,180
agree on what deliverables, what needs to be produced by Tuesday, and to make

27
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,260
it snappy is to do it quickly. Oh, okay. When you're talking.

28
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,220
You're using that word, right? Oh, make it snappy.

29
00:02:54,940 --> 00:03:06,940
All right. So let's listen to a short scenario and imagine you're in this

30
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:13,020
this meeting. If you were to hear that in a meeting, what would you

31
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:21,020
do to interrupt to try to understand? If you had some sort of question, you have

32
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,820
the main idea, right? But you wouldn't probably want to listen to what comes next a

33
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,820
little bit. How would you ask for clarification?

34
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:42,140
Well, as you mentioned, everything is about listening. So I think I will wait the

35
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:47,900
person to end what that person is (going to say)? And if I don't understand, then I will go

36
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:55,900
and like, hey, I need clarification on this part of what I just say.

37
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,780
So you would wait for the person to finish saying what they want to say.* And that's because

38
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:11,580
you don't want to be rude or interrupt anyone when they're talking. Yes. Actually, I always

39
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:18,940
tried to wait because you need to know what the person is thinking and not just to think like

40
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:27,180
that's what you're saying. So it's good not to make assumptions. I agree. And it's great to wait

41
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:33,980
for those pauses in speech and conversation to know when we can ask for clarification.

42
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:40,940
Okay. So how do we interrupt politely? That's part of what we're talking about today.

43
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:47,260
Asking for clarity. They're useful phrases. Well, I would say, excuse me,

44
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:53,340
what's like, that would be a good example.

45
00:04:53,820 --> 00:05:07,820
So I will say, excuse me, I just would like to know what you are trying to say when you are

46
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:18,380
talking about this contract or something like that. Okay. So I need more clarification on these

47
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,980
subjects. All right. It's very formal. I like that.

48
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:32,140
Yes, we need to... that's like our environment when we talk with we have our meetings.

49
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:40,060
We can make* jokes outside, you know, but then we are with the meeting where we need to try to be

50
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:47,980
a really like professional. You can be more casual outside of the meeting, but in the meeting

51
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:56,380
itself, it's time to be professional and formal. All right. So this language register is really

52
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:04,700
a bit formal and also intonation is important. You know, sounds rise and they fall too. So an

53
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:12,540
example would be sorry. Could you please repeat the part about COB or could you repeat the part

54
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:22,620
about making it snappy? What does that mean? All right. So now notice that we use could here and could

55
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:31,180
is considered more polite than can. So could is a little bit more formal and then can is a little

56
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:37,020
bit more casual, although you can use either one. Someone is not being disrespectful if they use can,

57
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:43,180
but if you want to show more formality, it's better to use could. Here's another example.

58
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:50,460
This time I would like for you to try to raise the intonation at the end. So is that right?

59
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,780
All right. Is that right? Can you, can you read this part here?

60
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:03,260
If I understand correctly, you're asking us to, is that right?

61
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:10,860
Is that right? Yeah. And here's another example. We're working a lot. Is that right?

62
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:19,260
We have to come in this weekend. Is that right? All right. How about this one? Can you read

63
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:26,780
this one for us? Could you please explain what you mean by snappy?

64
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:35,580
Uh-huh. Very good. Hi, snappy. Well, snappy means it should be different.

65
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:48,700
Well, no, I think that's fine. We can use, for example, like the one you said COB because

66
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:54,700
there are some people* that don't know what COB means. You could just simply ask, could you

67
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:59,580
tell me what snappy means? I don't know this. It's a new word for me, you could say.

68
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,940
You know, I think sometimes we feel embarrassed when we don't know something.

69
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:11,740
And so we don't want to ask, we don't want to admit, but it's okay to clarify.

70
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:16,460
The whole purpose of communication and business is to understand and be understood.

71
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:24,060
And a key takeaway from this slide here is basically we use could to make polite requests.

72
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:31,900
You can use discourse markers like excuse me or if I understand correctly you're asking

73
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:37,500
or you're telling us that's right and then rephrasing what they say. Those are really great ways to

74
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:45,900
ask for clarification. All right. So go ahead, I'm sorry.

75
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:55,900
No, maybe before I didn't use to do that, but now like I feel more confident to ask for

76
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:03,980
the meaning of the word, to (know) what they're saying. So we know what they're exactly there trying

77
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:10,380
to communicate. Yeah... it only gets better with time.
