00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,030
My name is Mr. Brown and this is

00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:05,430
a video for my second grade language class

00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,730
during the coronavirus quarantine in Comayagua, Honduras.

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,090
Hello everybody, I hope all of you are

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,890
happy and that you are washing your hands.

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,870
Today our objective is to spell common verbs

7
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:25,670
and pronounce them correctly by watching a slideshow

8
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,730
and writing the words together.

9
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,430
Does anybody know what a verb is?

00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,290
A verb is an action word.

11
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,410
Do you remember when we played Simon Says

12
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:40,790

00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:42,030
Yes?

14
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,630

When you understand the images, you will be

28
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,090

29
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:43,570
