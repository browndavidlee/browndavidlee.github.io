00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hello, welcome to class. Again, welcome. My name is David Brown and this is going to be an original combo reading writing and grammar class. I'm glad that you're all here. Have a seat everybody. Welcome.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Hey, Hector. How are you?

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Just fine. How are you?

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm doing great. Thank you.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Welcome. Welcome.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Thank you.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I see that you selected a class about arguments. Would you like to learn how to be more persuasive in today's class?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I would like to. I would love to actually because that's a very important thing to do when you speak another language.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yeah, the basic question of this is what do we want and how do we get that? And communication is the means in which we acquire the things that we want.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So learning to be persuasive is just really an amazing soft skills to learn.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And there are procedures that we can follow in order to persuade effectively. So in today's lesson, we'll talk about persuading effectively and about some grammar reading and writing task that can help us to persuade formally.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We have this concept of cohesion and cohesion is when something is whole.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
In order to make a good argument, we need to have all the parts of the argument.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And we also need the argument to be smooth. It has to flow. So we have cohesion and those two concepts that we'll talk about a little bit today.

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So let's explore how we can achieve this.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So I have an image on the screen here. It says from jumbled ideas to a clear persuasive point.

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We see this guy with a messy room.

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
He's torn over curtain there.

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And it makes it look clean there.

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It actually looks like mine.

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
All right, all right.

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We have our arguments are like this, right?

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Our arguments can be messy or they can be organized.

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And if our arguments are presented in an organized way, then we're more likely to convince people that something is true.

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We want to do this genuinely. How can we genuinely organize our ideas to make a persuasive point?

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Let's see if you can remember something about arguments or tell me what you think you know about persuasion.

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What are two parts of an argument that you remember?

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Remember any specific parts?

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Actually, I can't remember it.

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You know, like being so organized.

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And let me see the other one.

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You said, organized.

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And messy.

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay.

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And the opposite will be organized, right?

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So being organized versus his versus messy.

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
How about the structure of an argument?

38
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
How do you argue effectively?

39
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What is something that you need to do in order to make a good argument?

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Well, actually, I need to, I need to make it so comprehensive.

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Right? For the person that is.

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Listen to one argument. Right?

43
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And it has to be easy.

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
To understand.

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And easy to understand too.

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Agreed.

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So if we improve some of these aspects of grammar, like cohesion and flow, we can make it easier to understand.

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We can make it organized and not messy.

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And we can make it whole. We can make it comprehensive.

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So these are our learning objectives for today's class.

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Can you read this first objective for us?

52
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yeah, learning objectives for today.

53
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Analyze a model argument for structure and flow.

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You want me to read all of them?

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Okay.

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Utilize a graphic organizer to the construct arguments.

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Understand how grammatical choices impact clearly.

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And cohesion.

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Practice using transitional device says effectively.

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And identify and correct common errors affecting argument clearly.

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Alright, let's practice two of these words here.

62
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
This one is pronounced repeat after me clarity, clarity.

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Oh, clarity.

64
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Okay.

65
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And this one is with a Jen sound, like a Z.

66
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
ZJ kind of sound cohesion.

67
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Cohesion and clarity.

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Okay.

69
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah, I didn't notice it was.

70
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The word as with clear.

71
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I confuse it actually.

72
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yeah, it's related to the word clear.

73
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So clear.

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yeah, it's related.

75
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The same thing.

76
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Right.

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That's what I think.

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Uh huh.

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So you have clarity, which is the noun and something is clear.

80
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's the adjective.

81
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yeah.

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Alright.

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So what we can start off with first is the anatomy of an argument.

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The different parts of an argument.

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And this is something that we can learn.

86
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And remember from the days in school, when we would write essays and things like that.

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
How do you structure an essay?

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What comes first, next, and then last, when you write?

89
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Let's read this part here.

90
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Can you read this paragraph for me?

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Sure.

92
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
A well crafted argument resembles a well engineered structure.

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It requires robust components and seamless connections.

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Cohesion ensures ideas interlinked logically.

95
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
While fluency allows the reader to navigate the argument smoothly.

96
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Okay, excellent.

97
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So I made this image here to demonstrate this idea geometrically.

98
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So we have the idea that an argument is complete.

99
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
But an argument can be complete, but not flow well.

100
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
An argument can have all of the parts, but they're not put together.

101
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So if we look at each stage of this, we see that it starts with a few elements that are not connected very well.

102
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
They're not connected via the reasoning that we need.

103
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
We see that it starts to form, but it doesn't have good flow.

104
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And when the flow improves, we end with the perfect circle.

105
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So this illustrates the idea of a cohesion, which is it being whole.

106
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The hexagon in this picture has cohesion, but it doesn't have flow.

107
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
This circle, on the other hand, has cohesion and has flow.

108
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So how can we do that?

109
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
How can we structure our paragraphs and our essays?

110
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So that it is organized that it contains all of the parts that it needs.

111
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And so that it transitions from one part to the next logically.

112
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And if we do that right, if we do it effectively, then we have both of those elements and we strengthen our argument.

113
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So we have these argumentative elements, the puzzle pieces, cohesion, the connective structure, and the fluency, the smooth flow between ideas.

114
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
All right. So we need to remember these core components of an argument.

115
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Let's read these here. Can you read these for me?

116
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Sure. Can I read it from the very beginning?

117
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Like recall the core components of an argument, claim, actually, background, ceases,

118
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:53,000
topic sentences, evidence, examples, potential, rebuttal,

119
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:03,000
and conclusion, a solid grasp of this element is foundational.

120
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Very good.

121
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So we have the claim. Another word for claim is a thesis.

122
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
We have the background, which is the context of what we're talking about.

123
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
If we start talking and we start arguing, but nobody knows what we're talking about with the background of it, then it's not clear.

124
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So we start with a claim.

125
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
We can give us some background information about that.

126
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And then we have our thesis statement.

127
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:37,000
This is a thesis statement that is basically the main argument of the entire thing we're trying to convince the other person to believe.

128
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So to persuade is to convince someone else to believe something.
