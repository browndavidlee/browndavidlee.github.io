00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Hello, welcome to class everybody. My name is David Brown. This is a grammar class. Hello. Welcome. Welcome to class. Norma. Welcome. Hello. Thank you. How are you? I'm doing good. How are you? I'm doing great. Thank you.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Norma, did you have a good weekend? Yes, I had* a good weekend with my family.

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Great. Excellent. Did you spend time with, you have a son, right? His name is Jose Pablo? Yes. He always tries* to play with me. So I can do anything at home about just playing with him.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Okay, that does sound like a good weekend. In this lesson, Norma, we're going to talk about weekends and we'll talk about regular and irregular verbs, the difference between those two.

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And how to describe our weekends using pronunciation and also sequence adverbs. Let's read these objectives here. Can you see the screen, okay? Yes, I can see it.

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Okay, great. Let's start by reading this part right here. Can you read this line for me? Talk about the past. You see all past verbs like washed, went, ate.

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:45,000
to describe finished events. Okay. And the next one? And then the next order. Order your story. Use special words. First, then, next. After that, finally, to tell things in the right order.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Sound clear, practice saying -ed verb endings correctly. Okay. And write your story. Write a short paragraph, three to five sentences about a personal past event.

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Okay, great. So these are our goals for today's lesson.

10
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We see that we have the past, the present, and the future. We have different conjugations and many students struggle with the past tense quite a bit for two reasons: One, there are different ways to pronounce verbs that end in ED.

11
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And also because there are so many irregular past tense verbs, probably more than 200 irregular past tense verbs that we need to memorize.

12
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So we see that the basic verb structure is basically verb plus ed. And that's the simple past. And that works most of the time. So we just add ed to the end of it. For example, we have finished and in the past, it is finished.

13
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:03,000
A base verb, and then the rest. Here's an example here. Can you read this example for me?

14
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Present, watch TV, past, yesterday, I watched* a movie.

15
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Okay. Good. We're going to practice some pronunciation a little bit more. It could be difficult for native Spanish speakers to pronounce that ch sound in watched.

16
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But you'll get it. Don't worry.

17
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And so we see an example like this one, too. They play soccer. And then in the past becomes they played soccer. And you can hear a different pronunciation for this one. 

18
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:45,000
In the first one, a /t/ sound, the second one, a /d/ sound. And then here's another example. Can you read this one for me?

19
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
She cooks dinner past she chicken dinner last night.

20
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Great. So the basic spelling rules are that we need to add ed to the end of the verb.

21
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:08,000
There are some times when we need to change the y to i and then add ed. For example, study becomes studied or cry, 

22
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
becomes cried  with i ed.

23
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But most of the time, you'll just add -ed to the end of the verb to make it past tense.

24
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
All right. Let's continue. Do you have any questions for me before we continue on?

25
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:39,000
No, I just want to, as you mentioned, it is difficult. This is one of the most difficult parts when I start learning English, the past tense because of that pronunciation part.

26
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But we try practicing and practicing.

27
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I understand. And it's normal to feel a little bit nervous when we try to do difficult things.

28
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So far, you're doing really, really good exceptional. So don't worry, Norma.

29
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
All right. So one challenging thing, as you mentioned, is knowing all of these are regular verbs.

30
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And so we need to memorize them. There really is no way around memorizing these different verbs.

31
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Of course, we need to use them in context, but we really need to memorize all of these irregular past tense verbs.

32
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So we have some examples here. The past tense of go is went...the past tense of eat is ate.

33
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The past tense of have is had* the past tense of see is saw past tense of drink is drank past tense of make is made.

34
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Good pronunciation. The past tense of buy is what? Bought.

35
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Oh, okay. And how about this one?

36
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Past tense of wake up is woke up.

37
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
All right. And then we need to remember these conjugations for the verb to be.

38
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So not only do we have a regular one, sometimes they look totally different in past tense conjugations.

39
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So we have be and then was or were for the word to be.

40
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
All right. So these are just a small sample of irregular verb.

41
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I really recommend that when you have time, try to find lists of these irregular verbs and use them.

42
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Think about them whenever you speak about the past. Make sure that you're conjugating them correctly.

43
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Let's test a couple of these. And I think we can continue on because you're doing really well.

44
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The past tense of go is went the past tense of have is had the past tense of drink is drank.

45
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Good. The past tense of buy is... Bought?

46
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Wow. Okay. Your pronunciation really has improved a whole lot. I'm really impressed.

47
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Thank you.

48
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
All right. So we have three different ways that we pronounce these verbs that end in -ed.

49
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And we've had some implicit practice with this before, but I think it's really useful to understand some of these rules too.

50
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
We have three different sounds that we make whenever we pronounce verbs that end in -ed.

51
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
One is with a /t/sound here with your teeth.

52
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The other one is with a /t/ sound and it's behind the teeth right there in the alveolar ridge, it's called.

53
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's where we pronounce the d-d sound. And then we have the id sound.

54
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So it starts with this vocal sound here is where vowels come from.

55
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And then it ends with the dip sound in the roof of your mouth.

56
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So we have dip and id and it depends on the final consonant.

57
00:07:49,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So the final consonant sound of watch, for example, is ch repeat repeat repeat.

58
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
There you go. Very good. All right. So we have watched? This one's very difficult.

59
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Watched? Watched? Watched? Watched? Very good.

60
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Great. And look becomes. Look.

61
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Looks very good. Stop is. Stop. Right. So we don't have a sound that starts here with the a /t/ at the end.

62
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And then we have the d sound. Remember in the roof of the mouth.

63
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So we have play in the past becomes remember /d/. Repeat after me.

64
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Very good. Played. Played.

65
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Good. This one? Opened.

66
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Great. And this one?

67
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Lived. Wow. Perfect. Awesome.

68
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So you can memorize these rules here.

69
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You can learn them after some time of just practicing and hearing them for a long time.

70
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But if you remember that if it starts or rather if the final consonant is L B and B G M R Z or J,

71
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
then it will result in that /d/ sound at the end.

72
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
The most important rule to remember is that when the final consonant is "t" or "d",

73
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
then we're going to pronounce the -id at the end.

74
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So we have wanted in the final consonant is "t".

75
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,000
wanted it's wanted the final consonant of need is what? Needed.

76
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So it's D. The final consonant is D. So it's needed and decided.

77
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Decided. Perfect. All right. So we add an extra syllable with that id sound at the end.

78
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I think we can continue on. How do you feel?

79
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Does this seem easy to you or is it a little too difficult or what do you think?

80
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I think you're doing great.

81
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
No, I feel comfortable.
