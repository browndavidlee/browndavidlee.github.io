00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
Hi, my name is David Brown and this is a reading writing class.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:11,600
Persuasive in your communication be useful for you, your studies, your future

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,400
career, and etc.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:28,080
Being more persuasive in your communication be useful for you.

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,600
To be more persuasive means to be able to get other people to do what you want.

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,880
To do what you want, exactly.

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:46,480
How to be more persuasive?

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:56,640
Well, you have to learn, they say, once I heard, once you know the crowd you are talking to,

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:04,800
you have to learn how to talk the same way they talk so they can understand you better.

10
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,120
But at the same time, with their same words, with the same way they talk,

11
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,880
you have to teach them something.

12
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,040
And once you teach, they can be able to follow you.

13
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,760
I think everyone has something that they can persuade us of if they just have the ability

14
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,920
to do that, those communication skills to talk and express themselves well.

15
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,600
It's not easy.

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,800
No, it's not easy, I agree.

17
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,640
It can be difficult.

18
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,160
And this is something that we can improve.

19
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,120
We can learn how to be more persuasive in our communication.

20
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:54,560
And something that Frederick Douglass teaches us about, if you read his autobiography and we'll

21
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,160
read a section of it today, you'll notice just how persuasive he is.

22
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,440
He's just a really good writer, a really great persuasive writer for this cause.

23
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,280
And his words made a big impact because he was so persuasive.

24
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,080
So recap here, who was Frederick Douglass exactly?

25
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,240
You can see a collage of images here.

26
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,680
This is from the pre-civil war, civil war era.

27
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:27,280
You can see other examples of abolitionists in this photo here.

28
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,680
So he was born in 1818 and died in 1895.

29
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,880
Of his prime was during the Civil War, he was an African-American social reformer, abolitionist,

30
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,920
or writer, writer, and statesman.

31
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,360
Can you read this part for us here?

32
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:54,960
After escaping from slavery in Maryland, he became a national leader of the abolitionist movement.

33
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,360
Famous for his powerful speeches and writings?

34
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:09,360
Excellent. In fact, Abraham Lincoln knew about this man and had read his writings.

35
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:17,920
And it was some of his writings that inspired him to go along with this movement.

36
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,640
So we have a chart here.

37
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,440
We're going to think about what we know already about Frederick Douglass,

38
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,520
maybe what I've told you already, or what you've heard before, or what you know about the

39
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:37,440
Civil War already. What do you know already about this abolitionist or the Civil War?

40
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,600
From what you told me, well, he is an African-American, a slave.

41
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,120
He learned to read from others.

42
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,400
He wasn't taught how to read, but he learned from hearing other people how to read, right?

43
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:06,400
And he died of 77 years old, and he escaped from slavery in Maryland.

44
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:14,000
And once he learned how to read, he was a famous <?>.

45
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,280
He was a famous writer.

46
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,920
Writer. Famous abolitionist and writer. Excellent.

47
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,440
You're a good listener. Thank you.

48
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,720
Now, there are new things to learn here. What questions do you have about Frederick Douglass?

49
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,760
What kind of things would you like to know about him?

50
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,760
Oh.

51
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,880
Okay, it says that he escaped from slavery. Why did he do after that?

52
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:50,640
Yeah.

53
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:03,920
And how do you think you'll find out? Well, I think we can find out through today's lessons and

54
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:10,480
activities, but actually what we're going to read today has more to do with his thoughts before

55
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:19,520
he escaped. I still think you can have some idea about what he had to do or what led him to

56
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,240
being able to escape. And this is something else that maybe you'll be able to

57
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,360
read after this lesson today as well if you'd like to finish reading his autobiography.

58
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:41,680
And some of his writings. So we have some vocabulary that we need to focus on. We'll read a passage

59
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,280
from Frederick Douglass's autobiography where he describes his determination to learn to read

60
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,640
and write. Nothing could stop this guy. He did everything he could to educate himself in

61
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,640
a world in which it was very taboo for a slave to learn to read and write.

62
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,600
Okay. These are some vocabulary words that we need to know here. I'd like for you to take a look

63
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,920
at these and their definitions. We have strategies. Can you read the definition for me here?

64
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,040
Clever tricks. Clever tricks are plans used to achieve a goal.

65
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,520
Deprovity.

66
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:32,320
I cannot see it out. Moral corruptions or wickedness. Wickedness.

67
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:41,520
About this one. Shuttle. In item of first, how do you pronounce it?

68
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,600
Shuttle. Shuttle. It sounds like a French, right?

69
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:55,440
An item or personal property. In slave people were legally

70
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:08,320
considered shuttle. So it's basically like a worthless object. They were treated like just

71
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:15,680
objects, just things that could be used and thrown away. And this one precepts, precepts.

72
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:24,640
Rules are principles guiding behavior. Apprehension.

73
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,600
You hear me.

74
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,520
Apprehension. You hear me? Apprehension.

75
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:44,480
Fear. Now I can. Fear and anxiety that something bad will happen. Also understanding.

76
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,120
No. Urchins.

77
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,640
Urchins mischievous. No, I don't know how to pronounce it.

78
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,800
Mischievous. Mischievous.

79
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,760
Often poor and regularly closed children.

80
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,080
They have sea urchins. Sea urchin is the type of sea creature with spikes on it.

81
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:18,320
But you can use them to describe children to urchins for good.

82
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,360
And this one, vindication. Vindication.

83
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:31,920
And vindication. Clearing someone of blame. Oh, and suspicious. Proof that someone or something is

84
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:44,000
right or reasonable. And a boy. A boy. To regard with disgust and hatred.

85
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,000
And hatred.

86
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,320
So we use this as a verb to abore something, to really hate something.

87
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,840
So a lot of these words really highlight some of the things that we'll talk about through our

88
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:03,360
reading or read together. When we read, we'll try to focus on the meaning, although I can help you with

89
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,880
pronunciation. I don't want it to.
