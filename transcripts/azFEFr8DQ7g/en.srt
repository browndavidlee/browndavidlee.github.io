1
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:15,490
[Speaker 1]
Okay. I'm not pretty sure because I've never been to one or already, but I would

2
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:29,650
[Speaker 1]
try to get some help out of someone, right? That could help me because I'm an elderly person. So

3
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:35,730
[Speaker 1]
it's, things are more difficult for us than to a young person. So I would.

4
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,650
[Speaker 2]
We call for help. You would call someone on your phone where we could call out for help.

5
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,270
[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Yeah. If that was a situation, I call for help actually. Yeah.

6
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,310
[Speaker 1]
Well, you can say help. Help just to get me out of the flood.

7
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,850
[Speaker 1]
You know, the thing is like, it's like static in there because that's a tunnel and it has,

8
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:52,950
[Speaker 1]
at the very end of it, it has to like higher points. So the flood comes right in between

9
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:59,030
[Speaker 1]
into the tunnel and out the tunnel.
[Speaker 2]
It's like a pool of water.

10
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:05,830
[Speaker 1]
Yeah. It wasn't like a pool that you can actually go and swim. Yeah. I will have hope. I will ask

11
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:12,950
[Speaker 1]
for help actually. That's what I would do, you know, or maybe if I can, if I cannot find help,

12
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:21,990
[Speaker 1]
I will start running and trying to grab things around me so I'm not to get, you know, in the

13
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,230
[Speaker 1]
flood and try to escape from there.
[Speaker 2]
If it flooded, I would swim because I know how to swim,

14
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:29,430
[Speaker 2]
but do you know how to swim?
[Speaker 1]
Just a little bit. I get cramps whenever I try to swim, so

15
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,190
[Speaker 1]
I'm not trying to do so because that comes terrible.
[Speaker 2]
If you don't have to, you wouldn't try.

16
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,490
[Speaker 1]
Yeah. And especially the water, the flood, I mean, it's kind of nasty in that part.

17
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:41,730
[Speaker 1]
All the people from some parts of the city, they are thrown to that part. So I don't,

18
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:49,390
[Speaker 1]
it's not recommendable.
[Speaker 2]
I think a better hypothetical situation would be to be in a

19
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,930
[Speaker 2]
good place with your family, someplace where you're safe and just going to get food to eat.

20
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,350
[Speaker 2]
That sounds like the perfect hypothetical situation.

21
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,490
[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I wish I could be safer than that.

22
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:02,210
[Speaker 2]
Here's a question here. We've looked at some general conversation starters

23
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:10,950
[Speaker 2]
and hypothetical questions. Let's try to connect these to your own thoughts

24
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,410
[Speaker 2]
and potential conversations, things that you'd like to talk about.

25
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:20,250
[Speaker 2]
So we can look back at these conversation starters that we've had and the hypothetical

26
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:28,110
[Speaker 2]
questions and try to think about the most interesting types of questions and how we

27
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,710
[Speaker 2]
might answer another one in a real conversation. What type of situations would you use these types

28
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:41,940
[Speaker 2]
of questions? Let's try to categorize this a little bit more. Previously, I showed you a list

29
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,980
[Speaker 2]
here of these different questions. The first question says, what's the most interesting

30
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,380
[Speaker 2]
place you've ever visited and what made it special? If you answered that question there,

31
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,960
[Speaker 2]
when would you ask this question in a conversation?
[Speaker 1]
What kind of situation?

32
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,680
[Speaker 1]
Well, I would like to ask somebody that I recently met. We start a conversation

33
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:08,620
[Speaker 1]
just like an icebreaking thing, right? And just to break the ice, I would start a conversation

34
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,540
[Speaker 1]
telling, well, if I see that they're interested in that type of conversation.

35
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:21,620
[Speaker 1]
But, you know, it's like a very common thing to do, to talk about yourself when you're being

36
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:27,660
[Speaker 1]
introduced or introducing yourself to somebody, right? And you're looking for questions or,

37
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,540
[Speaker 1]
you know, history that you can tell.
[Speaker 2]
It's great to have a question that

38
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,220
[Speaker 2]
you can answer because then you know what you can say. But it helps the other person,

39
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:42,460
[Speaker 2]
too, if you can ask them a question like this as well. It makes the conversation go

40
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:49,060
[Speaker 2]
smoother. They go both ways as well.
[Speaker 1]
Yeah. And especially that question that I answered,

41
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,240
[Speaker 1]
which is the first one, because, you know, you start talking about your working places,

42
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,540
[Speaker 1]
right? And if they tell me, where have I worked? So I tell them in the airport.

43
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:05,040
[Speaker 1]
So they ask me if I got to travel a lot, because being an airport employee,

44
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:12,780
[Speaker 1]
they start asking things like that. I used to work for a very small airline,

45
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:19,360
[Speaker 1]
right, that works only, flights only locally here within the country. So I used to talk about

46
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,920
[Speaker 1]
our islands, San Pedro Sula, which is a northern point place here in the country. And that's just

47
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:33,080
[Speaker 1]
to break the ice and start a conversation. I usually, or talking about their family,

48
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,040
[Speaker 1]
where they're from, and all that kind of stuff. Just to break the ice. That's always the same

49
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:45,800
[Speaker 1]
thing.
[Speaker 2]
This is something that you're really comfortable with yourself. You've had these

50
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,480
[Speaker 2]
conversations a lot in English. So if we need to step outside of the comfort zone a little bit,

51
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,600
[Speaker 2]
maybe we could ask another one of these questions. Okay. If you could choose another

52
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,540
[Speaker 2]
question besides the first one, which question would you choose? And when would you ask this

53
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,560
[Speaker 2]
question?
[Speaker 1]
Okay. Let me just read them back again. Tell me about a challenge you overcame.

54
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,480
[Speaker 1]
What did you learn from it? What's something you're looking forward to in the near future?

55
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,760
[Speaker 1]
What hobby or activity do you enjoy that others might find surprising? Okay. One of the things

56
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,120
[Speaker 1]
is just to get a new job. That's one of my challenges, because even if I'm an elderly

57
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:26,400
[Speaker 1]
person, but I need to support myself. I'm not used to being supported by somebody else.

58
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,880
[Speaker 1]
I've always been a provider, so I need to get me a job myself. And it's been hard and challenging

59
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,740
[Speaker 1]
to me, because as I told you, I'm an elderly person, and you know, possibilities in my country,

60
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:43,360
[Speaker 1]
there are not too many for people like me or somebody else my same age and things like that.

61
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:52,140
[Speaker 1]
But, you know, the more prepared I am, the faster I'll get a job, right? But even if you study a lot

62
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,520
[Speaker 1]
sometimes and you have a lot of experience, that's not enough in this country, because

63
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:04,680
[Speaker 1]
you've got a lot of competition with younger people well prepared for the kind of job that

64
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,960
[Speaker 1]
we might be applying for.
[Speaker 2]
I'm really sorry to hear that it's been so challenging.

65
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,200
[Speaker 2]
I know in many places it's a challenge for elderly people to find equal opportunities.

66
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,100
[Speaker 2]
But just after talking with you a few times for a few classes, I can really tell that you have

67
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,260
[Speaker 2]
some awesome communication skills. You have some impressive experience. And if I were an employer,

68
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:29,140
[Speaker 2]
I would really be interested in your resume and your experience. You have a lot of great things

69
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,300
[Speaker 2]
to offer and might have problems finding opportunities in Honduras, but I don't think

70
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,540
[Speaker 2]
you would have any type of problem finding opportunities in other places. I think you

71
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:47,800
[Speaker 2]
do it. You just have to believe in yourself. We have some really wonderful skills and communication

72
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,000
[Speaker 2]
skills. I'm so impressed by your ability to put things into words.
