Hello, my name is David Brown and this is a pronunciation class.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hi, welcome. How are you?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hello, thank you. I'm doing well. And you?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm doing great. Thank you. What's your name?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
My name is Lourdes. Lourdes Landa.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Hi, Ms. Lourdes. Welcome. I'm Mr. Brown. Where are you from?

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm from Tegucigalpa Honduras.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Okay, Tegucigalpa. Awesome. My wife is from Tegucigalpa.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Oh, that's nice.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yeah, nice to meet you.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Nice to meet you, too.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I see that you selected a lesson about these different TH sounds. Is that okay?

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yes, that's right.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Okay, we have two sounds that can be tricky. We have the TH sound that is voiceless and the TH sound, which is voiced.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Both involve putting your tongue between your teeth.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
One, the voiced one has a vibration and the voiceless one does not have a vibration.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We need to know when to use this and when to remember how to use these different sounds here.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So we'll start. So a question. Have you ever said is sync when you meant to say think or free instead of three?

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I think I've done that before you.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And it's pretty common. Even some native speakers, some native speakers, for example, will say birth day with an F instead of a TH sound.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
A little bit of practice. You know where to put your tongue. If you know what sound it makes where the sounds come from.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It can easily be fixed. You can learn to hear and produce these differences and sounds.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Okay.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So here are some objectives. I'd like for you to read these.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Well, I want you to listen to these objectives here. So we're going to be able to distinguish between these T8 sounds. We have the voiceless and the voiced fricatives.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,000
We're going to describe and demonstrate the correct mouth movements mechanics for these different sounds.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I will be able to produce these accurately in isolated words and also in short phrases as well. So we'll try to use them in context.

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And we'll try to recognize and come and spelling patterns associated with TH.

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And you need to basically notice and correct yourself whenever you use TH and practice.

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So it's some fine tuning for pronunciation in today's class.

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
How do you feel about your pronunciation? Do you feel like you need to work on your pronunciation?

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes, definitely.

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Okay. I think this is a good class even for some of us native speakers to as well. So no worries if you feel nervous. It's completely normal.

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And don't feel afraid to be silly. It's a pretty silly class when you're making weird sounds with your tongue and teeth.

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Thank you.

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That improving this can help you in your daily conversations or at work. By the way, Lord, what do you do? What is your job?

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I actually work with the government.

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The legal department in an office.

39
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And there's just a few people that can actually speak English. So when something like that comes near my help.

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And I think that is going to be very useful if I know the proper way to pronounce these kind of words because it gets confused.

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Okay, definitely. So you have a good reason to practice this today and to improve your pronunciation.

42
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:10,000
We need to understand these two different sounds and what voiceless and voiced means because well, anytime we talk, we can feel vibrations or not.

43
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So if you put your hands in front of your throat here, if you can do that for me.

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And just start talking. Say something. Maybe a phrase.

45
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Hello, my name is Noah. Hi. Yes, I can definitely feel that.

46
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So you see that there are moments when it vibrates and moments when it doesn't vibrate.

47
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Essentially, these voiced sounds with ED at the end voiced are vowel sounds that will find in different parts of the word.

48
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:50,000
These are voiced sounds. And the ones, the sounds that we make that don't vibrate here are the voiceless ones.

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So we see in the chart that we have two different examples, one for the voiceless thick.

50
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And there's no vibration. So if you put your hand here, if you put your hand here for me and say, thick,

51
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
thick, you shouldn't, you shouldn't feel any vibration at all for that one, right?

52
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Again, thick, no vibration. Maybe for the, yes, but for the TH, no, right?

53
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Now, this next one, please, you try again, even the tongue vibrates, right?

54
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So if vibrates, yeah, all the way up, this vibration and the vocal track continues onward,

55
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and we have this voice sound with these. So we have the voice sound with TH and with this vowel sound here.

56
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So a certain consonants can also come along with different types of voice sounds too, like these voiced fricatives.

57
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So this is the sound in words like, think with no vibration, right?

58
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Thank, then, back, path and three.

59
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Thank.

60
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Now, make sure that your tongue goes between your teeth. Can you read this part for us here?

61
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Think, think, think, think, back, three.

62
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay, good. So notice that these don't vibrate.

63
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So we don't want to confuse these and say, think, for example, the sounds more like a dip sound.

64
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:47,000
We don't want to use voice fricatives when we're not supposed to and vice versa.

65
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So it takes some memory and some vibration here.

66
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So we practice the TH sound here. Remember, you should feel no buzz there.

67
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Let's try this again. We'll try the, and the, the, for the sound, you can feel a little bit of air on your hand.

68
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Can you say,

69
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I guess the, uh, at the end is a bit.

70
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What the, uh, I think, what the TH sound there is not voiced.

71
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's a subtle difference, but an important one for pronunciation.

72
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So we can see some differences between these.

73
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Essentially, they only difference.

74
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You have the tongue between both, uh, tongue between your teeth and both of these pictures.

75
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
But for the voiced fricative, you also have that vibration.

76
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Alright, so I think I've explained that and you understand, right?

77
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
This is the sound in words like now we have the buzz.

78
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I think I do. I know I have to practice.

79
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So we have the buzz sound in these words. So listen to me say it once.

80
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
We have this. So you have a vibration.

81
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:20,000
This, that, then, mother, breathe, and they, you try.

82
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Okay, let's see.

83
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Breathe, that, then, mother, breath, they.

84
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Good. This one here. Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe.

85
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Good. Breathe.

86
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Huh? So notice that vibration there should be like a sound, like a buzz.

87
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Breathe. Good.

88
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Much better.

89
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I think you see fear to make the other sound.

90
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Another example of some sounds that have a voiced one will be like the letter S.

91
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Sometimes it makes a sound too, versus that sound, which is voiceless.

92
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So the only difference there.
