Hello my name is David Brown and this is a pronunciation class. Hi David. I'm

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,280
fine thank you. How are you? I'm doing great. Thank you. Thank you. Welcome. Thank

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:22,120
Thank you, David. Are you ready for your lesson today? Yes. All right. All right. Well we

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,040
can practice this lesson that I see that you selected. We have this short

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:34,720
i sound and then this long e sound the short i sound is like /ɪ/ and then the

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:42,800
long e sound is like /iː/, right? Okay. This is important for us to master because it

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:50,240
can cause confusion for native English speakers and it's a really

8
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:59,160
commonly mispronounced pair. So we have some examples here. Some funny

9
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:09,960
examples. We have fill and feel, sit and seat, chip and

10
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:22,480
cheap. This one is bit. This one is beat, beat, ship and this one is sheep. This

11
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,680
is lid and this one is lead. All right. So we need to know the difference

12
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:36,000
between the /ɪ/ sound and the /iː/ sound, the /ɪ/ sound and the /iː/ sound. Okay. The

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:45,080
short /ɪ/ versus the /iː/ sounds. So this is what we'll practice in today's lesson. Two

14
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:53,760
different sounds. For example, what is this? This is ship*, ship, very good. And this

15
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:05,600
one, these are, these are sheep. These are sheep, right? Regular plural noun. So we're

16
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,280
looking at two English sounds that can be a little bit tricky but are very, very

17
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,880
important for clear speaking. We want to understand and be understood and this can

18
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:23,640
impact our comprehension. So it can change the meaning of words. We have this one

19
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:30,960
which is ship and this one which is cheap and that is just one example. So today we

20
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:38,040
have two objectives here. I'd like for you to listen to these objectives. Today you

21
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:50,760
will learn to hear the difference between /ɪ/ and /iː/ and say /ɪ/ and /iː/ more clearly. Let's

22
00:02:50,760 --> 00:03:04,800
try this. Can you repeat it for me? /ɪ/. Now, /iː/, /iː/, /iː/, /iː/. Awesome. And so we have a little

23
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:12,400
activity here to practice. I said that you would need something like a stick and something

24
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,440
like a block. So I have a colored pencil and one of my daughter's blocks. Do you have

25
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:24,800
something? Okay, yes, yes, I have something. Okay, okay, like this. Alright, so let's

26
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:32,480
imagine that we have the /ɪ/ sound and it's like tapping a block. Okay, right? So tap /ɪ/

27
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:39,880
your block, say /ɪ/. Now we have the /iː/ sound which is longer. You can imagine that you have

28
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:50,520
your pencil and you're dragging it against something, /iː/, /iː/, /iː/. Good, /iː/. Alright, so

29
00:03:50,520 --> 00:04:00,160
listen again, /ɪ/, /ɪ/ /iː/, /iː/. Notice that your jaw changes. So you have your tongue in a position

30
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:06,120
of your mouth higher for one than the other. It's all about the position of your tongue

31
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:14,200
in your mouth, /iː/ sound versus the /ɪ/, which is a little bit more relaxed. Okay. Do you hear

32
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:22,480
the difference? Yes. Okay, excellent. So the short i, the /ɪ/ sound is a little bit

33
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:31,200
different than the /iː/ sound, the /iː/ is more, and it's /iː/ with the tongue higher up. We have

34
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:39,920
the /ɪ/ sound with the jaw lower down, /iː/, you see my mouth, /iː/, alright? Okay, now you

35
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:51,800
don't want to say /ɛ/, and this is, we have the /ɛ/ sounds like lead (metal), and we have the /ɪ/ sound

36
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:58,400
like lid, and then we have the /iː/ sound like lead (to guide). And all of this depends on the position

37
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:09,120
of your tongue in your mouth. We have /ɛ/, /ɪ/, and /iː/. Repeat after me, /ɛ/, /ɪ/, /iː/   /ɛ/, /ɪ/, /iː/

38
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,040
/iː/. Very good. Alright, so there are some differences in these sounds depending on the position

39
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:21,160
of your tongue or jaw. So your mouth needs to be a little bit more open than with the

40
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:27,240
/i/ in Spanish. Your lips are relaxed, not smiling and not tight. So with the /ɪ/, it's like

41
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:36,080
this little bit more and it is just /ɪ/, /ɪ/, right? Not /ɛ/. The tongue is a little high, a

42
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,000
little to the front, and you'll need to relax your tongue a little. And it's a quick, a short

43
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,560
quick sound like a little tap in the block sound, right? Okay. Feel it, relaxed. So try

44
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:57,000
making this sound yourself. You can mute it. Try making this sound yourself again. Let

45
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:10,400
me hear you. Okay, /ɪ/, /iː/ And then /ɪ/, and /iː/, very good. Excellent. Okay. Alright.

46
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,600
And just a little bit of this practice can make a big difference. So now I want you to

47
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,800
show me... you can use a mirror or you can use the camera too. If you're too shy to use the

48
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,880
camera, that's okay if you want to use a mirror. So look at your mouth in the camera.

49
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:46,360
Okay. Like this. You can see /ɪ/, /ɪ/, /ɪ/, /ɪ/, not /ɛ/, but /ɪ/... /ɪ/ , and /iː/, /iː/, /iː/, /iː/, /iː/, /iː/, perfect.

50
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:54,040
Alright, so you have the mouth, which has the lips spread wide, like a rubber band, for

51
00:06:54,040 --> 00:07:00,520
the /iː/ sounds, and it's high into the front, and you can feel a little bit of tension. So

52
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:09,400
we have the, this one, which is the /iː/ sound, this is /ɪt/, and this one is /iːt/, right? Right.

53
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,600
It's a long, stretch sound, like pulling something. So you can imagine for the /iː/ sound

54
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,920
that you have, like rubber bands pulling in the corner of your mouth for this one.

55
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:31,960
So you can see this in the image here. You have the, /ɪ/ sounds here, which is the center

56
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:39,400
in the front. The jaw is mid to close, and it's relaxed. And then the /iː/ sound is more spread

57
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:46,920
apart. It's a little bit more closed, and the tongue is a little higher up. That's a

58
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:54,200
good job. Alright, so let's practice some of these. Here's an activity for us. You've got

59
00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:02,840
your block and your pencil or pen, or whatever, or stick. Okay. So when you, when I say,

60
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,920
or when, and when you say a word that has this short /ɪ/ sound, I want you to tap the block.

61
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:17,160
Okay. And then when it has a long /iː/ sound, and then I want you to slide your stick. You ready?

62
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:26,680
I'm ready. All right. So ship. Repeat, ship, ship.

63
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:45,000
Uh-huh. Ship. Ship. Get. Bed. Bed. Beats. Beats. Ship. Ship. And ship.

64
00:08:45,000 --> 00:09:02,440
Sheep. Good. Sit. Good. Fill. Feel. Feel. Good. All right. We can practice a little bit more with this

65
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,800
/ɪ/ sound.
