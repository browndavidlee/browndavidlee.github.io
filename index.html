            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my professional portfolio for the Arizona State University Teach English Now! TESOL Specialization. This collection showcases my understanding of TESOL methodologies, practical application in lesson planning, and reflections on my journey as an English language educator.</p>
            <p>Here you will find examples of my work, including lesson plans, teaching demonstrations, and my evolving teaching philosophy, all aimed at fostering effective and engaging language learning environments.</p>

            <div class="additional-welcome-content">
                <p>My teaching journey began with my decision to share what I love. In developing countries, learning English can make the difference between success and poverty. It can open doors. Learning languages changes our brains for the better, promotes intercultural dialogue, and changes our perception of the world around us. I believe that the world would be a better place if people understood and respected cultural differences.</p>
                
                <div id="moreWelcomeText" class="collapsible-text" style="display: none;">
                    <p>I am a native English speaker from Arkansas. My short-term goals are to connect with my students, understand their differences, plan according to their needs, set expectations, and establish a welcoming, content-rich, fun, and structured environment. My long-term goals consist of leading my students to become independent, persistent, self-controlled, curious, conscientious, gritty, and self-confident individuals. I want my students to meet the demands of employers looking for leadership, teamwork, problem-solving, and communication skills. Above all, I agree with Plutarch, who said, “A mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be kindled.” I want my students to fall in love with learning languages too.</p>
                    <p>Like most modern teachers of English as a Second Language, I am experienced in the Communicative Approach (1980). I teach middle school, high school, and adult students. Delivering content-rich, authentic material is essential for cultivating communication in the context of problem-solving. Group and pair work, and the assignment of roles, are important in the formation of leadership and collaborative skill-building. I enjoy incorporating music, games, popular culture, and developmentally or personally interesting conversational topics. Drama, plays, and written or self-written dialogues are all parts of my methodologies. Authentic and relevant materials, combined with excellent delivery, keep students engaged. Successful schools continue to take the latest research on approaches into account. My methodologies reflect the breakthroughs in research and technology in ongoing education.</p>
                    <p>Another approach that I use is the Comprehension Approach (1980). Techniques in this approach, such as role reversal and flipped classrooms, are interesting ways to demonstrate understanding according to the levels of understanding as outlined in Bloom’s Taxonomy (1956). Everything is built upon the past, which continues to offer helpful methods, such as the Direct Approach (1900) that introduced the concept that it is vital not to use the first language in the classroom. The Grammar Translation Approach, which requires direct translation, is not something that I use explicitly in my classroom. Providing rich visuals and audio stimuli without using the students' first language is a vital part of my presentations. Modern approaches, such as Task-based and Project-based learning, which allow for cognitive flexibility, support my skill-based philosophy. Ultimately, using a variety of multisensory approaches keeps students motivated and engaged.</p>
                    <p>It starts with a hook. Marketing students learn that to capture the attention of the audience, they need to use ethos, logos, or pathos. Gaining the confidence of my students is a matter of persuasion. When lesson planning, I ask myself which techniques I can use to make the subject relatable, purposeful, and measurable. As students shuffle into the classroom, chatty from recess or lunch, I ask myself how I can capture their interest. It could be an interesting statement or quote on the board, a visual or projected image, music, or a do-now activity. Getting the students to routinely and quickly transition from procedural parts of the lesson allows for the best use of time. A short warm-up activity can set the tone for a great lesson. For example, a fun kinesthetic activity can make all the difference for Monday morning teenagers. When everyone feels connected and happy, their affective filter is lowered, and learning flourishes.</p>
                    <p>I make sure that if a student does not know the answer, they don’t have the opportunity to opt out. For example, if a student says, "I don't know," I'll come back to them. I make sure that students are able to collaboratively build upon their understanding of the content through scaffolding techniques. Collective praise through stomps, claps, snaps, or applause is a great way to engage the class. Surveys using a show of one or two fingers are a great way to collect more information about student understanding. I interactively lecture for only 20 percent of the class time, and students are given guided and independent practice for the other 80 percent of the class. Throughout my lecture, I like to circulate, answer any questions, and check on student progress. Giving short, timed goals is a great way to keep groups on task. I maintain a positive attitude throughout my circulation. Discretely helping struggling learners and connecting with them can make all the difference in classroom management. Summative assessments are routinely planned throughout the grading periods (partials), and the process aims for student success.</p>
